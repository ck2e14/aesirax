Aesirax contains a high-performance, zero-dependency DICOM decoder & serialiser. Decoding a DICOM binary is the precursor to anything else; consuming applications must know what datatypes and values they're handling. That's why this parser supports plugins, but is a work in progress.

Aesirax is a learning repo. Please do not use any code it contains in production. 

Note that this is a fresh, replacement repo to dodge unpicking something I completely cooked in version control.
