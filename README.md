Aesirax contains a high-performance, zero-dependency DICOM decoder & serialiser - find this under /Parsely.

Aesirax is a learning repo. Please do not use any code it contains in production. 

Note that this is a fresh, replacement repo to dodge unpicking something I completely cooked in version control.
