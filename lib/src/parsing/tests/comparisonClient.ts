// this file needs to be able to generate run test cases based on dynamic input. So i want to basically 
// pick one or two battletested libraries that i can use to compare the outputs for and make sure they 
// are identical - or rather identical in their respective modes of serialisation or data structure.


// ideally just use js/ts libs rather than like cli-wrapping because that is going to need to have 
// transformation steps which means you're also testing your transformation steps not just making output 
// comparisons.
